# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1  Overview

**Product name:** Vibe Exchange — Real-Time Currency Exchange iOS App  
**Version:** 0.1 (MVP)  
**Author:** Alexander Lee  
**Date:** 22 May 2025

### 1.1  Goal

Deliver a fun, intuitive iOS application that shows real-time exchange rates for the world’s major fiat currencies and lets users convert amounts instantly. The MVP must follow Apple’s Human-Interface Guidelines (HIG) and be ready for App Store submission.

---

## 2  Background & Opportunity

Travellers, online shoppers, digital nomads and expatriates frequently need up-to-date currency information. Existing tools are either cluttered with ads, too utilitarian, or slow to load. A lightweight, delightfully designed app can win loyalty, enable future premium features (e.g., offline packs, historical charts) and serve as a showcase for **vibe-code** rapid development.

---

## 3  Target Audience

- International travellers planning or already on trips
- E-commerce shoppers purchasing abroad
- Digital nomads & expats who monitor rates
- Forex hobbyists needing a quick reference

---

## 4  Assumptions & Constraints

1. **API** – app.exchangerate-api.com provides live rates in < 1 s and supports 1 000 free calls/day (API key supplied).
2. **Connectivity** – typical mobile network (3 G+) available; fallback to last-cached rates if offline.
3. **Platform** – iOS 17+; Swift 5.9; SwiftUI as primary UI framework.
4. **Design** – must pass App Store review and comply with GDPR.
