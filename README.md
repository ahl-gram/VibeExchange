## 🚀 Getting Started

This project has two parts: the iOS application and a serverless backend. Both must be configured for the app to work.

### 1. Backend Server Setup

The backend is a serverless proxy built for Vercel. It manages the API keys and makes requests on behalf of the iOS app.

1.  **Navigate to Server Directory**
    ```bash
    cd VibeExchangeServer
    ```

2.  **Install Vercel CLI**
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

3.  **Link to Your Vercel Project**
    ```bash
    vercel link
    ```
    Follow the prompts to link to your Vercel project.

4.  **Set Environment Variables**
    You need to set two secret keys on Vercel.
    - `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY`: Your key from exchangerate-api.com.
    - `APP_AUTH_KEY`: A unique secret key you create to secure your proxy. You can generate one with `uuidgen`.
    ```bash
    # Add the API key for the exchange rate service
    vercel env add EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY

    # Add the secret key for authenticating your app
    vercel env add APP_AUTH_KEY
    ```
    You will be prompted to paste the value for each key.

5.  **Deploy to Production**
    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```
    After deployment, Vercel will provide you with a production URL. **Copy this URL.**

### 2. iOS App Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd VibeExchangeProjFolder
    ```

2.  **Create Secrets File**
    The app uses an `.xcconfig` file to manage secrets securely. This file is ignored by Git. Create it now:
    ```bash
    touch VibeExchange/Config/Secrets.xcconfig
    ```

3.  **Add Authentication Key**
    Open `VibeExchange/Config/Secrets.xcconfig` and add the `APP_AUTH_KEY` that you created and set on the Vercel server.
    ```
    APP_AUTH_KEY = "YOUR_APP_AUTH_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Configure Server URL**
    Open `VibeExchange/Services/CurrencyService.swift` and replace the placeholder URL with your Vercel production URL from the previous step.
    ```swift
    private var baseURL: String {
        return "https://your-vercel-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/exchange-rate"
    }
    ```

5.  **Open and Run in Xcode**
    ```bash
    open VibeExchange.xcodeproj
    ```
    - Select your target device or simulator.
    - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run.

## 🔒 Security Model

The app uses a secure proxy pattern to protect the third-party API key.

- **No Client-Side API Keys**: The key for `exchangerate-api.com` is stored securely as an environment variable on the Vercel server and is never included in the iOS app.
- **App Authentication**: The iOS app authenticates with the Vercel proxy using a secret key (`APP_AUTH_KEY`). This ensures that only your app can access your proxy.
- **Secure Key Management**: The `APP_AUTH_KEY` on the client side is stored in a `Secrets.xcconfig` file, which is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.
- **App Transport Security (ATS)**: ATS is enabled to enforce secure HTTPS connections for all network requests.

## 🎯 Key Components

### CurrencyService
- Handles API communication with exchangerate-api.com
- Implements intelligent caching (10-minute TTL)
- Provides offline fallback functionality
- Supports exponential backoff for error handling

### FavoritesManager

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### API Key Protection
The app implements multiple layers of security for API key protection:

1. **Encrypted Configuration**: API keys are base64-encoded in `Configuration.plist`
2. **Keychain Storage**: Decrypted keys are stored in iOS Keychain
3. **Runtime Access**: Keys are never exposed in plain text in source code
4. **Secure Retrieval**: `KeychainManager` handles all sensitive data operations

### App Transport Security (ATS)
Comprehensive ATS configuration ensures secure network communications:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>exchangerate-api.com</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
            <string>TLSv1.2</string>
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <false/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

### Security Components
- **KeychainManager**: Secure storage using iOS Security framework
- **ConfigurationManager**: Encrypted configuration file parsing
- **CurrencyService**: Secure API key retrieval and usage
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data properly encrypted
